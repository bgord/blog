## 2019

Ok, so 2019 is officially over

From a technological standpoint, it was a pretty good year for me.

I managed to deepen my knowledge in almost every frontend related topic.
This year I kept betting on React, and with the latest additions to the library (hooks and suspense), it's been one the most joyful tools this year.

Also, in the second part of the year, I switched to being a full-stack developer, so I had to brush up my backend skills.

Additionally, I made my first cross-platform mobile app with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) (I recommend it!).

Other hot choices from this year would be:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - it finally clicked and I cannot imagine writing JavaScript without it
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - the best and most reliable E2E testing tool out there, my go-to for web-apps
- [AdonisJs](https://adonisjs.com/) - a Laravel-like backend framework

## 2020

So, what's next?

I plan to learn rather vertically than horizontally.
So I will focus more on deepening my existing knowledge base then learning new languages.

That said, what are the new technologies I'm looking forward to learning?

### Finite state machines

I'm vaguely familiar with state machines, but I feel that my code could benefit from incorporating them.
The tool that I'm going to start with is [xstate](https://xstate.js.org/docs/) and it's great [visualizer](https://xstate.js.org/viz/).

### PostgreSQL

Even though I'm can write pretty advanced queries, there's still so MUCH about databases.
I chose Postgres because it's the most advanced and powerful database engine.

### GraphQL

It's getting some serious traction.
I have consumed GraphQL APIs working on a frontend app, but never built any meaningful backend with it.
The tools I'm planning to explore are: [Hasura](https://hasura.io/), [Postgraphile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/), and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

Happy New Year ðŸŽ‰!
