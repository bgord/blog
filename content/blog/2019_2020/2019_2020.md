## 2019

Ok, so 2019 is officially over!

From a technological standpoint, it was a pretty good year for me.

I managed to deepen my knowledge in almost every frontend related topic.
This year I kept betting on React, and with the latest additions (hooks and experimental suspense), it's been the most joyful tool to use.

In the second part of the year, I switched to being a full-stack developer, so I had to brush up my backend skills.

Additionally, I made my first cross-platform mobile app with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) which I really recommend!

My other hot choices from this year would be:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - it finally clicked and I can't imagine writing JavaScript without it
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - the best and most reliable E2E testing tool out there, my go-to for testing web-apps
- [AdonisJs](https://adonisjs.com/) - a Laravel-like Node.js backend framework

## 2020

So, what's next?

The most important thing is I would like to become more of a specialist than a generalist.
Having said that, I will focus more on deepening my existing knowledge base then learning new languages.

What are the new technologies/concepts I'm looking forward to learning?

### Finite state machines

I'm vaguely familiar with state machines, but I feel that my code could benefit from incorporating them.
The tool that I'm going to start with is [xstate](https://xstate.js.org/docs/) and it's great [visualizer](https://xstate.js.org/viz/).

### PostgreSQL

Even though I can write pretty advanced queries, there's still so much to learn about databases.
I chose Postgres because it's probably the most advanced and powerful database engine.

### GraphQL

It's getting some serious traction.
I have consumed GraphQL APIs working on a frontend app, but never built any meaningful backend with it.
The tools I'm planning to explore are: [Hasura](https://hasura.io/), [Postgraphile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/), and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

Some other technologies I might want to look at this year: [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), or [Go](https://golang.org/).

Happy New Year ðŸŽ‰!
